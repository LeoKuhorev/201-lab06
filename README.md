This is a "cookie-stand" project for Code Fellows 201

deployed site link: https://leokuhorev.github.io/cookie-stand/sales.html

So far sales.html page generates a list of cookies sold at each location for an imaginary store.

The data for the lists is basing on this table:

| Location      |  Min / Cust | Max / Cust  | Avg Cookie / Sale | 
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 1st and Pike  |  23         | 65          |6.3                |
| SeaTac Airport| 3           |24           |  1.2              |
| Seattle Center| 11          | 38          |3.7                |
| Capitol Hill  | 	20        | 38          | 2.3               |
| Alki          | 2           |  16         |  4.6              |

for every hour of operation it generates a random number of customers between min and max customers from the table above
